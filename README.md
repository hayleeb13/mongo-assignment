# mongo-assignment

* This project uses a variety of tools including mongodb and handlebars to create a data scraping application.
* The program displays article information from a website when the user clicks on the scrape button.
* The user is also able to save favorite articles and create notes.
* The project is useful because it allows someone to interact with a webpage while also storing the data in mongodb.
* Simply get started by using the deployed heroku app or running node server.js.
* NOTE: At this point the app is not functioning, the data from the website is being scraped and stored but is not displaying on the webpage. I believe the issue may be with the app.js file or with the handlebars files. Will continue to work on app and update once issue is fixed. 
* Any questions or issues regarding this program can be directed to Haylee Bell
